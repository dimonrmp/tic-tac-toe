# Tic-Tac-Toe


### What the project does?
The exercise of building Tic-Tac-Toe game teaches how to manage state across parent and child components and helps understand how 
component lifecycle works by mounting (creating) components on the DOM, updating them, and unmounting(deleting) them from the DOM so they're no longer displayed.

### Installation/How to run
Clone the project, run the local web-server, open index.html

### Roadmap of future improvements
Here is the list of the future improvements I would like to implement as/if necessary:
1. Change the color of the turn and winner status bars from red to off-white.
2. Hide the who winner is line while the game still is in progress, once the winner is identiifed, hide
    'Next player' line and show only the winner.
3. Make sure that each square can only be played once in a game. After all squares are filled, if no winner is identified,
    a draw (tie) should be concluded and displayed as well as the reset button to start a new game. Same applies if winner is identified.
